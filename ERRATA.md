## Errata for CodeBook.md and README.md

* Both documents made references to 68 measurements. This is incorrect, and it should be 66 measurements.  
  While drafting both documents, I mistakenly counted 68 from the last data set.
  
* The references to 68 measurements can be found in the 2 locations:
  - In CodeBook.md. Under Data Transformation, the second statement.
  - In the README.md. In the 5th paragraph, the second statement.
  - In both the above statements, they should refer to 66 measurements instead.

* Instead of correcting both documents, I have chosen to add this errata document.

* Thanks for reading.
